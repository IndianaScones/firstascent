# Progress log

Running log of what was done each session and what's next. Newest entry first. See `PROCEDURES.md`.

## 2026-10-12 (Studio SSH key auth)

**Phase-rule exception:** one-time exception granted for this task only. It allowed reading and editing `.vscode/sftp.json`, reading the installed SFTP extension's files, running the Windows OpenSSH `ssh-add -l`, and editing, committing and pushing `CLAUDE.md` and `progress.md` (normal push). The "Current phase" section is unchanged.

**Done**
- Studio SFTP switched from password to SSH key auth. `.vscode/sftp.json` now uses the extension's `agent` option pointing at the Windows OpenSSH agent pipe, which holds the `bga_studio` ed25519 key. The extension (Natizyskunk SFTP 1.16.3, ssh2 1.13.0) supports that pipe. VS Code deploy verified ("SFTP: Diff Active File with Remote" worked).
- The old password is confirmed dead: Studio rejected it after the key upload, so no admin reset is needed.
- The backups from the git cleanup were deleted by Jonathan.
- `CLAUDE.md` file-map row for `.vscode/sftp.json` updated.

**Next**
1. Freeze investigation (review first, writing `FREEZE_INVESTIGATION.md`).

## 2026-10-12 (SFTP config removal)

**Phase-rule exception:** one-time exception granted for this task only. It allowed editing `.gitignore`, rewriting git history, making the two copies of `.vscode/sftp.json` (a file backup and the mirror clone), reading the password once for the history check, editing `CLAUDE.md` and `progress.md`, and force-pushing after Jonathan's confirmation. The "Current phase" section is unchanged.

**Done**
- `.vscode/sftp.json` is untracked (listed in `.gitignore`) and removed from all git history with git-filter-repo. All commit hashes changed.
- Verified no revision of the rewritten history contains the file or its password.
- `CLAUDE.md` file-map row for `.vscode/sftp.json` updated.
- Force-pushed to origin (all branches and tags) after Jonathan's confirmation.

**Follow-ups for Jonathan**
- Delete the mirror backup (`../firstascent-backup.git`) and the file backup (`../sftp.json.backup`) once the push is verified. The mirror still holds the old history.
- Re-clone, don't pull, on any other machine with a clone.
- Check that the Claude.ai project's GitHub sync shows the new history.
- Consider asking GitHub Support to purge cached views of the old commits.

**Next**
1. Switch Studio SFTP to SSH key auth.
2. Freeze investigation (review first, writing `FREEZE_INVESTIGATION.md`).

## 2026-10-12

**Done**
- Docs reorganized into `misc/docs/` (`RULES.md`, `TODO.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `bga/current/`, `bga/legacy/`).
- `TODO.md` restructured.
- Markdown escapes fixed in `DECISIONS.md` and `TODO.md` (own commit); stray paste artifact removed from `TODO.md`.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `PROCEDURES.md` created.
- Guide Mode decision (not implemented) recorded in `DECISIONS.md`.
- `modules/utils.php` vs `modules/Utils.php` casing mismatch added to `TODO.md`.

**Phase-rule exceptions:** none.

**Next**
1. Remove `.vscode/sftp.json` from git and from git history (separate task, with a one-time exception to the phase rule; ends with a push).
2. Switch Studio SFTP to SSH key auth.
3. Freeze investigation (review first, writing `FREEZE_INVESTIGATION.md`).
